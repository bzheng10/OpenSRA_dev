Introduction
============



|short name| is an open-source software (|github link|) released under a **XXXX** license (see :numref:`lblLicense`). The |app| can be used to quantify losses from an earthquake or hurricane scenario in the form of *decision variables* (DVs). This functionality is typically utilized for performance-based engineering and regional natural hazard risk assessment. This library can help you in several steps of performance assessment:


Backbone Methodology of OpenSRA:
The program is trying to solve the following equation from PEER (Deierlein et al., 2003) at user-defined locations:
 
IM = intensity measures (e.g., PGA, PGV)
From PSHA
EDP = engineering demand parameters (e.g., seismic- or liquefaction-induced shear strains and/or permanent ground deformations)
From various methods and procedures with epistemic uncertainty
DM = damage measures (e.g., gas leaks, breaks, repairs)
Fragility curves from available methods (e.g., FEMA/Hazus) and those developed by subgroups
DV = decision values/variables (e.g., safety, costs of repair/upgrade)
From technical advisory committee or other user entities
λ = mean annual rate of occurrence for the intensity measure
from scenarios used in PSHA


Workflow:
The program is expected to work on a personal computer. For every run, the program goes through the following workflow:
Site characterization:
Define location of interest, with options for:
Region/grid
Individual sites defined by user
Entered manually or get locations from maps or networks of pipe/transmission lines
Get intensity measures (IM) at locations defined above:
Source characterization:
Use scenarios from UCERF3
Ground motion characterization:
NGAWest2
Run PSHA get hazard curves
Do we want to give the option for deterministic analysis?
Evaluate engineering demand parameters (EDP) at user-defined locations:
Allow users to select method(s) for analyzing EDP
one method at a time or parallel (a lot of inputs will be required if using multiple methods at once)
allow user-defined EDP functions?
For the selected method, show the list of required inputs, and:
Provide users the option to define input values themselves or use maps
Allow users to define their own fragility functions (?)
Allow users to define their own epistemic uncertainty for each model
Evaluate damage measures (DM) given EDP’s and/or IM’s
Allow users to select multiple fragility functions to use.
Allow users to define criteria for damage measures (i.e., generate conditional probabilities p(dm>DM|EDP,IM))
E.g., difference damage states (minor, moderate, severe)
Allow users to define their own fragility functions (?)
Allow users to define their own epistemic uncertainty for each model
Evaluate decision values (DV) given DM’s:
Options to generate various plots for multiple decisions, for example:
prob(dv>DV) vs. DM, EDP, IM
prob(dv>DV|DM) vs. DM, EDP, IM
Export results onto csv files(?)
