front end

- under sampling method, add button to clean previous samples

- add PGV contours

- under list of cases to run:
	- show list of parameters that uses user-defined values.

- embed layers interface under results

- "results" list under results tab should start with DV (repair rate), then shaking induced or deformation induced
----- subcategories (lateral spread, then ground settlement)

- weird large fontsizes when I open the program on 4k screen (or when switching between screens of different resolution)

- From Micaela: when she picked example 6, GUI resized automatically, then she tried to re-maximized the screen, but the widgets not resize properly 

- opensra.exe getting flagged a threat/trojan and removed by windows defender

- widget screen popups

- horizontal scrolling bar on input table not showing up when table extends beyong width

- gray out preferred variables drop down menus when "preferred configuration" is selected under "general"

- bullets for model parameters

- help widget (more thoughts needed)

- results tab: add button to open up working directory

- progress bar (more thoughts needed and need to interface with backend somehow)

- how to test program & experience

- how to update program

- polygon function for areas sounds interesting! helps crop out data to make analysis of results easier. i like! (Brian Low)

- glitchy after prolonged use (from Micaela), potentially memory leak?

- tie help menu to documentation (to do later)
