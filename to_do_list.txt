backend structure & efficiency

- incorporate multiprocessing/numba

- remove for loops for logic tree by adding 3rd degree for samples

- improve speed on getting IM predictions from OpenSHA

- instead of making cov for all sites and sample all at once, perform in loop and use filtered number of sites with large number of events
	- works better for large number of sites, but may sacrifice run time for low number of sites but high number of events
	
- convert current functions to base and derived classes (see https://github.com/arkottke/pyrvt/blob/master/pyrvt/peak_calculators.py)

- run subset of components from front end

- under sampling method, add button to clean previous samples

- add PGV contours

- bug "ex 3": repair rate for shaking induced not preselected
---- in output setup config file, don't see "RepairRatePGD"

- under list of cases to run:
	- show list of parameters that uses user-defined values.

- embed layers interface under results

- "results" list under results tab should start with DV (repair rate), then shaking induced or deformation induced
----- subcategories (lateral spread, then ground settlement)

- fontsize for program output menu

backednd features

- polynomial chaos

- fault rupture for shake map (area, union)
