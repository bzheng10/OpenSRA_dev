backend structure & efficiency

- incorporate multiprocessing/numba

- remove for loops for logic tree by adding 3rd degree for samples

- improve speed on getting IM predictions from OpenSHA

- instead of making cov for all sites and sample all at once, perform in loop and use filtered number of sites with large number of events
	- works better for large number of sites, but may sacrifice run time for low number of sites but high number of events
	
- convert current functions to base and derived classes (see https://github.com/arkottke/pyrvt/blob/master/pyrvt/peak_calculators.py)


backednd features

- polynomial chaos

- fault rupture for shake map (area, union)
