backend structure & efficiency

- multiprocessing.pool on haversine function

- remove for loops for logic tree by adding 3rd degree for samples

- find way to multi process IM from OpenSHA

- instead of making cov for all sites and sample all at once, perform in loop and use filtered number of sites with large number of events
	- works better for large number of sites, but may sacrifice run time for low number of sites but high number of events
	
- convert current functions to base and derived classes (see https://github.com/arkottke/pyrvt/blob/master/pyrvt/peak_calculators.py)

- use numba to improve speed by precompiling certain functions




backednd features

- polynomial chaos
